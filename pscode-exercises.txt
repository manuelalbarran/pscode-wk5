// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
Start	
	Declare num1, num2, sum
	Write "Add number"
	Read num1
	Write "Add number"
	Read num2
	Sum = num1+num2
	Write Sum
End


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Start
	READ input of a number
	IF number mod = 0
	PRINT ¨Number is Even¨
	ELSE
	PRINT ¨Number is Odd¨
End

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
Start
	WRITE ¨Please enter 5 numbers¨
	READ  n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
	WRITE ¨The average is¨
	SET avg to (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
	WRITE avg
IF(n1<n2)
	SET max to n2
ELSE
	SET max to n1
IF(n3>max)
	SET max to n3
IF(n4>max)
	SET max to n4
IF(n5>max)
	SET max to n5
	WRITE "The max is"
	WRITE max
IF(n1>n2)
	SET min to n2
ELSE
	SET min to n1
IF(n3<min)
	SET min to n3
IF(n4<min)
	SET min to n4
IF(n5<min)
	SET min to n5
	WRITE "The min is"
	WRITE min
